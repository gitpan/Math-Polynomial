		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.03
		    -----------------------------

- Added more text about interpolation in general and Math::Polynomial
  specifically to the distribution.

- Fixed a bug where the last constant was omitted if it was one. This
  bug was reported independently by Sergey V. Kolychev, John Hurst,
  and Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS).

- By a suggestion from Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS) I also changed
  the verbose format slightly to print 'x + -1' as 'x - 1' (and
  similarly for all negative coefficients). For the special case,
  where the first coefficient is negative, the minus sign is still
  printed as if it was part of the coefficient; e.g., '-3*x + 4' is
  still printed as '-3*x + 4'.

- By suggestion from John Gamble I moved Math::Interpolate to inside
  the Math::Polynomial package---the subroutine is very small and
  tightly coupled to the Math::Polynomial package.


		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.02
		    -----------------------------

Fixed a bug that caused erroneous behaviour when 0 was used in the
interpolation routine.
