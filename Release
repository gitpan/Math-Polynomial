Announcing the release of Perl Module Math::Polynomial and
Math::Interpolate Version 0.01

Math::Polynomial  - Algebra on polynomials
Math::Interpolate - Interpolate data using a polynomial

This package provides operators to preform algebra on polynomials. The
operators +,-,*,/, and % are all implemented, as are evaluation of
polynomials.

The package Math::Interpolate provides polynom interpolation using
Lagrange's formula, given a set of data points.

These two packages are distributed together, since Math::Interpolate
is quite small.
