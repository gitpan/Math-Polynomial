Additional documentation can be found in the examples subdirectory.

Note that version 0.04 is a beta release. The module is currently in the
process of an overhaul that may result in incompatible interface changes.
In particular, methods exposing implementation details rather than
mathematical properties of polynomials are going to become obsolete.
