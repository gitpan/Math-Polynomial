		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.04
		    -----------------------------

- Release date: 2007-07-12.

- New maintainer: Martin Becker.

- Bugfix [rt.cpan.org #4788] (reported 2003 by prospective maintainer):
  Method tidy() looped endlessly on zero polynomials.

- Bugfix: Crashed on adding a constant.

- Bugfix: Crashed on negating via overloaded unary minus.

- Bugfix: Division of polynomials of equal degree gave wrong results.

- Bugfix: Division crashed with non-"tidy" polynomials.

- Bugfix: Division failed to catch zero denominator.

- Bugfix: Verbose stringification produced lots of warnings under -W.

- Added more test cases.

- Renamed example directory, fixed imports and added table of contents
  there.

- Added some metadata to Makefile.PL.

- Added documentation of exportable subroutines, moved quotrem to
  subroutines section, clarified some definitions.

- Moved all imports to top of the module.

- Added more standard sections to POD, like VERSION, DIAGNOSTICS, LICENCE.

- Added development status notice to README.

		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.03
		    -----------------------------

- Release date: 2001-02-23.

- Added more text about interpolation in general and Math::Polynomial
  specifically to the distribution.

- Fixed a bug where the last constant was omitted if it was one. This
  bug was reported independently by Sergey V. Kolychev, John Hurst,
  and Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS).

- By a suggestion from Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS) I also changed
  the verbose format slightly to print 'x + -1' as 'x - 1' (and
  similarly for all negative coefficients). For the special case,
  where the first coefficient is negative, the minus sign is still
  printed as if it was part of the coefficient; e.g., '-3*x + 4' is
  still printed as '-3*x + 4'.

- By suggestion from John Gamble I moved Math::Interpolate to inside
  the Math::Polynomial package---the subroutine is very small and
  tightly coupled to the Math::Polynomial package.


		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.02
		    -----------------------------

- Release date: 1998-08-13.

- Fixed a bug that caused erroneous behaviour when 0 was used in the
  interpolation routine.

		    Math::Polynomial Version 0.01
		    -----------------------------

- Release date: 2007-09-11.

- Initial release.
